# Basic React Tutorial

A basic react tutorial bootstraped with create-react app.
This tutorial aims to teach you how to create a POS app "point of sale". For this case, my POS is a coffee product but this POS is generally applicable for all products.

# Setup / Installation
Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
Install [Create-react-app] (https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/installation.html)
Generate your starting files 

```sh
create-react-app my-app
```


After generating your starter files, your file should have like this:
  ```sh
      my-app/
         README.md
         node_modules/
         package.json
         public/
             index.html
             favicon.ico
         src/
             App.css
             App.js
             App.test.js
             index.css
             index.js
             logo.svg
```
